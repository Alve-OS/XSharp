# X# - XSharp
X# is a HLA (High Level Assembler) for X86/X64 assembly. In the future other flavors for ARM and other processors are planned.

X# is integrated into Visual Studio and we aer worknig on support for Visual Studio Code as well. X# can also be used using simple text editors such as notepad.

# Status
Currently X# is used by the [C# Open Source Managed Operating System (COSMOS)](http://www.goCosmos.org) and parts of it are bound to Cosmos. We are in the process of and nearly finished separating out X# to allow it to operate as a stand alone project to allow users to make their own custom creations using X#.
