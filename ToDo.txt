Change XSC to use Clogger

Plugins - Use XSharp.Build.Plugins

pre/post directives, separate api than normal pre/post
-as namespaces - process for - ie Cosmos.directive
pre/post as plugins

-Emit into ONE .asm file. If output file is specified, all goes to one. Else does one .asm per .xs as now. Also append optino to existing .asm

Publicity
Docs, Videos, website, Microsoft, C9

X# plugs
X# still has that hard ref to INTs last known address

X# method arguments

X# local vars - Zed style? . .. ..

Asm debugging, modularize DS and then Cosmos expands it. Remote over serial too

X# can be in C# with variable use etc through stack or special area for single X# calls

Change IL2CPU to use X# instead of XSharp.Assembler

DebugStub ReferenceHelper - Better way? Not needed if we merge probably, needed at all beyond?
Convert DebugStub as necessary

Move all X# code into Cosmos.CPU except that which is used as a plug to .NET Framework (that goes to CpuPlug, later)
CpuPlug

Redo parser (careful, need to work it out first).
Possibly can be done earlier as part of CXSC


To replace entirely current X# usage. 
Remove old syntax and support after all ported
Separate out X# into separate repo when it can stand alone.

VS Code support (Jp2masa already has code, work with him and merge it in)

X64, ARM etc
UEFI integration

Colorizer
1) Fix it to ignore stuff it doesnt know about
2) If #1, highlight entire line in red - or can we use red squigglies underneath easily?
3) Fix it to handle unknown errors more gracefully. Just ignore for now? Or how to report to user without a dialog every time...
4) Update to process /! - need to choose a color not alrady used. These are for directives like Namspace

Change all namespace in .xs source files to:
/! namespace ....

EmitUserComments
-Take from property first
-Each .xs can turn on or off with directive, or use inherit. If no directive, then inherit
  -Settings only apply for that .xs and reset to the master property when new .xs is processed
  -Same for .EmitSourceCode

.EmitSourceCode comments - if on then above each section it should emit a comment in the .ASM file showing the X# source.

/! include <file ref>
Does an inline include of the reffed file. 

Change VS items into X# / X Sharp
 name/section

Allow to be added to any .NET type library, standard, etc.. also VB.NET, C# etc


X# Project Type


Language Service - coloring, intellisense etc
  
We have some already - suggest to wait for parser upgrade before upgrading this too much

Make X# into a nuget pkg so users can find it easily

jp2masa ------------------------------------------

XSC
-append/output params (see program.cs)
-Expand program.cs etc in XSC to allow compiling from resources in .dll files

Can you modify our build process to to call XSC separately from IL2CPU? This will separate it out, and also let us handle plugins to XSC easier.

Move stuff to XSharp.Build
