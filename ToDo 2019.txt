2019 Work Plan

1) Reorg file tree (Kudzu)
  -ARM space
  -XSharp.Build -> XSharp.Tools
2) Colorizer - based on existing parser.
3) Get Each .asm emitting same as Gen1 
  -Swap out G1 for G2 in Cosmos.

-Finalize and complete all emitters
  -Emit DS for input to Cosmos via Gen2
-Directories
  -XSharp.Build -> Common\Build (Cosmos.Common.Build NS)
  -XSharp
    -XSharp
    -XSC
  -VS
-.xs Colorizing
  -Use same parser as we have now

-X#/ARM, X#/86

-Kill Gen1
  -Integerate G2 for Cosmos and IL2CPU

-Tree for source
  -ie XSharp stuff in an XSharp folder, spruce, etc.
  -Tree:
    Common - Need a name... Build stuff shared with Cosmos and other
      -Currently XSharp.Build - keep this or something else?
      
    Spruce
    XSharp
    VS - Stuff specific for VS 2019

-Implement "X# Projects"
  -No real need for .xsproj given how VS Code works?
  -Task that when F5 is used, can build and package ISO like Cosmos and boot it.
  -Share code from Cosmos
    -Where does the common code belong?
    -new Common subdir in source? Named what?

===========================================

VS Code
-.xs formatting

-DebugStub
  -Share with IL2CPU and Cosmos
