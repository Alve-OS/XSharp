Change XSC to use Clogger

pre/post directives, separate api than normal pre/post
-as namespaces - process for - ie Cosmos.directive
pre/post as plugins

Global - XSharp.cfg ?

Loadable plugins + core code in build for now

-Docs, Videos, website
-Nuget pkg (Charles)

Charles -------------------------------------------------

Colorizer
1) Fix it to ignore stuff it doesnt know about
2) If #1, highlight entire line in red - or can we use red squigglies underneath easily?
3) Fix it to handle unknown errors more gracefully. Just ignore for now? Or how to report to user without a dialog every time...
4) Update to process /! - need to choose a color not alrady used. These are for directives like Namspace

Change all namespace in .xs source files to:
/! namespace ....

EmitUserComments
-Take from property first
-Each .xs can turn on or off with directive, or use inherit. If no directive, then inherit
  -Settings only apply for that .xs and reset to the master property when new .xs is processed
  -Same for .EmitSourceCode

.EmitSourceCode comments - if on then above each section it should emit a comment in the .ASM file showing the X# source.

/! include <file ref>
Does an inline include of the reffed file.

Can you modify our build process to to call XSC separately from IL2CPU? This will separate it out, and also let us handle plugins to XSC easier.
