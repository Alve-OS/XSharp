pre/post directives, separate api than normal pre/post
-as namespaces - process for
pre/post as plugins

Global - XSharp.cfg ?

Namespaces for pre/post processor directives

  separate from normal pre/post processing

Loadable plugins + core code in build for now

Directives
Comments on/off/inherit

SourceCode on/off/inherit

Emit X# code as comments in .asm - might already do

Colorizer
1) Fix it to ignore stuff it doesnt know about
2) If #1, highlight entire line in red - or can we use red squigglies underneath easily?
3) Fix it to handle unknown errors more gracefully. Just ignore for now? Or how to report to user without a dialog every time...
4) Update to process /! - need to choose a color not alrady used. These are for directives like Namspace
