To debug this assembly use the VS Dev Hive.

To do that, set the following options in the project properties.
It requires a full path, but it is stored in the project .user file
so it will not interfere with others who do not have VS at the same location.

Alternatively, you can open XSharp.VS.csproj.user and modify it to include the
property group:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ProjectView>ProjectFiles</ProjectView>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU'">
    <StartAction>Program</StartAction>
    <StartProgram>$(DevEnvDir)devenv.exe</StartProgram>
    <StartArguments>/rootSuffix Exp</StartArguments>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>

$(DevEnvDir) is not accepted by the VS UI, so if you use the project properties dialog
enter the full path to Visual Studio. Also if changes are made using project properties,
it will expand $(DevEnvDir) it to a full path and save it.
